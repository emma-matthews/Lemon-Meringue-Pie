      <h2>Method</h2>
      Preheat the oven to 180°C. Lightly grease a 26cm loose-bottomed flan tin.
      In a food processor combine ground almonds, sliced almonds, spice, flour,
      sugar and melted butter and pulse until finely ground and mixture starts
      to clump together. Press mixture into base of the flan tin. Chill in the
      fridge for 20 minutes then bake for 10-15 minutes until just lightly
      golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile, place egg
      yolks, condensed milk, cornflour, lemon juice and zest in a medium
      saucepan and mix well. Heat gently, stirring with a wooden spoon, until
      mixture starts to thicken (about 4-5 minutes). Leave to cool for 20
      minutes. Whisk the egg whites with most of the caster sugar (reserve 1
      Tbsp), beating until thick, glossy and white. Pour lemon mixture into
      pre-cooked base and pile on the meringue, making sure to bring the
      meringue right to the edge of the almond shell to seal in the filling.
      Sprinkle with reserved sugar then bake for 15-20 minutes until meringue is
      golden and puffed.
